  middle child and put whitespace as a key of the top level +
- âœ… Renamed "name" to "type"
- Can I move all trailing whitespace into a ws key instead of in children?
- (related to whitespace) Fix the problem with tokens like "+" being both nodes with a left and right, as well as inline nodes in children arrays to support whitespace handling
- Impelement printing
- Implement optional whitespace flag
- glsl version switch to support glsl es 3 vs 1?
- Figure out the preprocessor strategy
